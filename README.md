## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

* Node installed
* Ready to be patient :) 

First, you'll need to install [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

`npm install -g create-react-native-app`


# Create our app `ReactFortunes`:

`react-native init ReactFortunes` 

# Test it out - iOS

`> cd ReactFortunes`
`> react-native run-ios`

# Create our app

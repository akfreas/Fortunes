## Getting Started

### iOS Code

Simply build and run the `iOSFortunes.xcodeproj` in the `iOSFortunes` directory. It should Just Work™️.

### React Native Code

In your terminal, `cd` to `ReactFortunes` and run either `npm install` or `yarn install`.
Then run `react-native run-ios` to start the app on the iOS simulator.
